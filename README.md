## Getting Started

### Local development server

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the local dev server: `npm start`

The project uses [`lite-server`](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server) for a lightweight development workflow with live reload. The server will open the landing page in your default browser and watch for file changes across the project.

### Static preview

If you prefer, you can still open any of the HTML files directly in a modern browser to explore the static prototype. All assets are local, and no build step is required.
